## Instructions for DIGI405 students

⚠️ **Run this notebook in Google Colab - not in the DIGI405 JupyterHub**. 

Click to [open in olab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/polsci/text-classification-with-transformer-models/blob/main/DIGI405%20-%20Text%20Classification%20with%20Transformer%20Models.ipynb)

You will want to change to a GPU/TPU accelerated runtime. To do this go to Runtime > Change runtime type. Read more about GPU/TPU availability in Google Colab [here](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#gpu-availability).
